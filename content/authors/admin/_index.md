bio: 
Sulaiman Dawood is a Research Assistant at Clarkson University in Potsdam, NY, USA. His expertise encompasses statistics, material characterization, machine learning, clustering, and material study. Currently, he leads the investigation of a novel concrete material sent from the International Space Station (ISS) for lunar surface applications. His research focuses on material development, unique curing conditions, and optimizing mixture proportions for geopolymer concrete with additive manufacturing (3-D printing) applications in mind. Utilizing advanced concrete characterization techniques such as SEM-EDS, nanoindentation, and optical microscopy, Sulaiman has explored critical factors influencing geopolymer lunar concrete, providing valuable insights for future lunar construction. His work has demonstrated positive durability results in space environments (ISS) and showcased the potential for producing structural materials on the lunar surface, achieving compressive strengths approaching 40 MPa with lunar regolith simulant-based geopolymer concrete.
